# Resource_Allocation_ML_Project
This project develops a machine learning system to predict healthcare resource allocation needs in Uganda using demographic health survey data. The system employs a two-stage approach: first, predicting population pressure scores using regression, then classifying districts into risk categories for targeted resource allocation.
